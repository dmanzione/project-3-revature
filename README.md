# project-3-revature
## Project 3 for the Revature Full-Stack Java with React training

*This is actually a fork of the original project, which was completed by the class as a whole. I forked and renamed the project to make it more visible and clear in relation to other Revature projects I completed/participated in. The backend part of the original project can be found* [here](https://github.com/orgs/bizbazaar/repositories)

This project had us implementing what we had been learning about:

*for backend*
- Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)
- Software Components
- Java Beans
- Loose and Tight Coupling
- The Dependency Injection design pattern
- The Inversion of Control (IoC) principle
- The Spring Application Framework, and how it is used to manage application components' (beans') lifecycle using a container
- How Spring can be used on top of Java EE
- Autowiring, annotations, and component scanning
- Autoconfiguration in Spring
- Spring Modules, in particular the Core and Beans modules in the Core Container, the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) module in Data Access/Intergration, the Web module, and Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP, but only an introduction)
- Spring Projects: Spring Boot

*for frontend*

- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
- Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)
- The Bootstrap Frontend Toolkit 
- JavaScript, functional programming, and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation
- TypeScript
- The Node.js JavaScript runtime environment
- Node Package Manager (npm) and node modules
- The React library to build user interfaces, which included
  - React Components (functional and class components)
  - Using props
  - Maintaining state in class components via this.state and in functional components via hooks
  - Material UI for React

*for deployment*

- AWS for continuous deployment, continuous delivery, and continuous integration: DevOps
- Containerization and Docker

*generally*

- As this was our first group project, we were taught about Agile methodologies and Scrum and applied the knowledge by doing sprints, conducting daily standups, etc., and had to learn how to create pull requests, forks, and more on GitHub
- How to consume REST API services with a frontend application: how to put them together into a Full-Stack application

## How to look at the code we wrote

The backend API and frontend application can be viewed by switching to the 'backend' or 'frontend' orphan branches in this repository
